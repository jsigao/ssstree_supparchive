## Data
This `data` directory contains the sequence alignment and the associated sampling time and location information, extracted from the XML scripts provided by the original studies.
Each subdirectory corresponds to one of the 15 empirical datasets, containing at least three files: the sequence alignment (`ali.fasta`), partition scheme (`part.nex`), and a spreadsheet of sampling times  (`seqdate.tsv`).
For eight datasets whose original studies performed geographic phylodynamic inference, we also include a `discrete_trait.txt` spreadsheet in the corresponding subdirectory to provide the sampling location data.
For each SARS-CoV-2 dataset, as the sequence data cannot be shared directly following GISAID's policy, we provide a supplemental table (`gisaid_supplemental_table.pdf`) generated by GISAID that is associated with the included sequence data; the supplemental table contains the EPI_SET ID that can be used to acquire the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID as well as a link directing to the acknowledgements associated with the sequences.
For the SARS-CoV-2 Brazil dataset (`sars2_can20` subdirectory), we also include an alignment file (`additional_seqs.fasta`) that contains the sequences that were directly obtained from the original study instead of GISAID.
