# Supplementary Archive for: Biological Causes and Impacts of Rugged Tree Landscapes in Phylodynamic Inference
This archive contains the materials that are necessary and sufficient to reproduce this study; it is divided into four directories: 
(1) the `data` directory contains the sequence alignment and the associated sampling time and location data;
(2) the `analyses` directory contains the `BEAST` phylodynamic analyses XML scripts and posterior output files;
(3) the `intermediate` directory contains the results summarized from the posterior outputs (which are then used as inputs for making the result figures and tables);
(4) the `summary` directory contains movies visualizing the progression of MCMC sampler in the posterior tree space (while other static summary figures and tables are presented in the manuscript and supplementary material);
(5) the `scripts` directory contains the `R`scripts for summarizing analyses, and;
(6) the `program` directory contains a modified version of the `BEAST` software package that implements a robust function for checking the irreducibility of a geographic model, required to perform the analyses under the asymmetric geographic model in our study.
This archive is also available as a Zenodo repository. Many of the `BEAST` posterior output files that are excluded from this GitHub repository due to their sizes are provided in an additional `beast_posteriors` subdirectory in the Zenodo repository.
